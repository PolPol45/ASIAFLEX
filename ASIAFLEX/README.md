# Legacy workspace (deprecated)

This directory contains legacy build artifacts and scaffolding from an earlier repo layout. The canonical project lives one level up in the repository root. All CI, tests, and development flows should target the root workspace.

> **Note:** New code should not be added here. Files are kept temporarily to ease ongoing migrations.
